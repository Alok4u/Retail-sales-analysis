# Retail-sales-analysis
**Description:** Led customer segmentation project, employing Python, data modeling, and visualization to uncover actionable insights from wholesale retail data, enhancing decision-making and marketing strategies.

**Project Overview:**

In this project, I analyzed a dataset of wholesale customer spending behavior to gain insights and help make informed business decisions. Here's the steps:
**Step 1: Data Exploration and Cleaning:**

then started by loading and exploring the dataset, checking for missing data and understanding the structure of the data & made sure that the data was clean and ready for analysis.

**Step 2: Data Modeling and Analysis:**
Next I created a model to segment customers based on their spending behavior. I use clustering techniques to group similar customers together & performed statistical analysis to understand the dataset better.

**Step 3: Visualization with Python:**

now I created visualizations using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. These visualizations helps to see patterns and insights in the data.

**Step 4: Presentation and Documentation:**

Finally prepared a report that summarized othe findings and insights & also included recommendations for decision-makers based on my analysis. The report included visualizations, explanations, and references to data sources.

**Provided actionable recommendations for decision-makers,** advising on optimized marketing, sales strategies, product offerings, and customer engagement tailored to each segment.
